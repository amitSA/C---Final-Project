C++ Serendipity-Booksellers-Project
===================================

This is the cumulative project for my C++ class, this is the repository to view the source code and run test out the executable of the project

Description
The program is a POS(Point of Sale) software which functions as a cashier to a users and a database to keep 
track of all the books in the inventory.  When the program is run, a menu screen pops up displaying 4 options for the user 
to select
   - option 1 enters the CashierModule which lets users buy and remove books from the inventory
   - option 2 enters the InventoryDatabaseModule which lets users add, edit, and remove books from the inventory
   - option 3 enters the ReportModule which displays to the console all the books in the inventory in a sorted fashion(sorted by Cost,Date added, or Quantity)


The executable is in the directory GroupProject\Debug
 NOTE: To run the executable your computer might need Visual Studio 13 allready installed in it
